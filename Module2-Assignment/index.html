			1. (If you haven't already) Create a GitHub.com account and a repository that you will use for this class.<br/>

2. (If you haven't already) Follow the Development Setup Video (beginning of Module 1) instructions on how to create a repository and set it up such that you can host and view your finished web pages on GitHub Pages, i.e., GitHub.io domain name. You will need to provide that URL for your peer review.<br/>

3. Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your solution to this assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example, module2-solution or mod2_solution, etc. Create an index.html file inside the solution container folder, e.g., module2-solution/index.html.<br/>

4. The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups: desktop, tablet, and mobile. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page, NOT 3 pages. In other words, you will be creating a single, responsive page.<br/>

5. Your page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. Your CSS file should be placed into a css folder under the solution container folder, e.g., module2-solution/css.<br/>
